# pages-test

Workaround to test various github sites before pushing to master. Needed since I miserably failed to install a local Jekyll server.

Under sites are the sites to be tested. Copy the contents of any subdirectory to `docs` and push to master to see the site at https://marcverhagen.github.io/pages-test/.
